<p>One of the important languages used to create dynamic web applications, change display to user, and animate elements is Javascript. I took on a beginners project that uses Javascript to create functions of the website, and features HTML, alone with CSS. This project involved me creating a Random Password Generator,that has criteria user selected. The purpose of th application is to create strong passwords for you to use to protect any sesnsitive data. A strong password ups the security. sThe webpage is coded to be responsive to different devices, and also has a interface.

 <p>For this project, I took an exisiting HTML and CSS code, and added Javascript to it to create several functions to met certain  criterias a person may want in a strong password. When you go to the webpage, you will see a button to generate the password. Once you click it you will be prompted to select criterias of the passcode to be made. In my Javascript file, I took character types (numeric, lowercase, upperchase, special), turned them into an array, then giving users an option to pick what type of characters to include in a new random password. I created an algorithm using functions to pick from user-selected character types, and put them together. The end result, is a complex password for the user to use as they wish.

  Here is a list of functions for the random password generator-
 ```
Series of prompts for password criteria
Password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
Character types including:lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
Generator that matches the selected criteria
```

## Installation
For the whole source code, you will want to link, a HTML, CSS, and JS file together. JS can be linked in the body of your HTMl.
For my code editor, I use [visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which can be installed from their website. A quick tip- have you HTMl opened in the browers, so you can refresh any time to see if any changes have been made, or if the functions are working properly.


## Usage 

Here is an example of the Random Password Generator.
